# OCD Patient Health Analytics

# Project Overview
This project focuses on the analysis of OCD (Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder) patient data to uncover critical insights using SQL and visualize them through an interactive Power BI dashboard. The dataset includes various attributes such as gender, ethnicity, obsession and compulsion types, Y-BOCS scores, and more.

Through this analysis, we aim to support healthcare professionals and researchers in understanding trends and severity patterns in OCD, assisting in informed decision-making.
